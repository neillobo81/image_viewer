-Tips for the TA:

-The user interface we have provided has been designed to be a click first interface, nearly every button seen
has a purpose and clicking it achieves a certain task at a particular time.

1) When clicking the Delete Tag button you will only see a back button, you can delete tags by clicking on the Tags
for the image above the back button.

2) The same principle applies with the revert, retrieve, and delete universal Tag.

   - With the revert button, you can press any of the logs on the right hand side that appear to revert back.
   - With the retrieve button, you can press any of the buttons on the universal tag Horizontal List at the very bottom
   to retrieve a tag to the image tag.
   - With the delete universal Tag button, you can press any of the buttons at the bottom to delete a tag only from
   the universal list of all tags.

3) After searching for an image using a key word, you can click any of the image buttons that show up on the right.


-Stuff you should know:

1) After changing your image will not dynamically change an empty image but rather stay the same, however every
 image on the right is from that directory or subdirectories of it.



- We hope you enjoy using the application! :)
